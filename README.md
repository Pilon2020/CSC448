### [Smith Waterman Algorithm](https://github.com/Pilon2020/CSC448/tree/main/SmithWaterman.py)
Working on getting a my own version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm working. Much of the information which I am checking against is coming from the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) on the topic. I found some previous code I found on [github](https://github.com/slavianap/Smith-Waterman-Algorithm/blob/master/Script.py) had published that I used as an aid whenever I got stuck.  
I have been able to get it to work with a basic gap penalty but as soon as I add in an Affine penalty in it breaks everything.
