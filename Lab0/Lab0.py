# Setting up libraries and basics prior to first true lab
# Install SciPy, NumPy, and sklearn libaries

# You are encouraged to use all built in scientific computing libraries available through SciPy and NumPy. In general, you should never (re-)implement classical computer science algorithms (i.e K-means) 
# but rather simply call the appropriate library.

# You are also allowed to use scripts and code from GitHub repositories of other scientists of their published research. You should properly cite the corresponding paper, see Project report for more details.

# You are not allowed to use any code from the internet which is not part of a published (in peer reviewed journal) scientific research.
